Cool commands:
Add a break after every case in a switch statement:
    :g/case//case\|default/norm Obreak;


Interesting things to get under my fingers:
vanilla:
  gm moves to the middle of a visual line in vim
  zh, zl, zH, zL
  z<Enter>, z., z- (don't really use these, just good to know)
  :<C-u> deletes the range that Vim automatically inserts in visual mode
  :<C-k><any key> tells you how to reference that key
  <C-g> gives you information about the current file
  1<C-g> gives information about the current file with the entire filename
  2<C-g> gives information about the current buffer
  g<C-g> gives information about the cursor position
  {visual}g<C-g> gives information about the selection
  ga gives information about the ASCII character under the cursor
  :%!xxd and :%!xxd -r can edit hexadecimal
  :%TOhtml creates an html rendering of the current file
  :g and :v do a lot of really neat things, like v/./,/./-j deletes
     redundant blanks
     Remember the uses of t, put, p, copy, y, d, i,
     and the meanings of 0, $, ., =, and how arguments to , can be empty
  /re/- or /re/+ or /re/-n or /re/n to jump lines before/after in a search
  `. to go to last edited position
  '. to go to last edited line
  gi reopen insert mode from the last place it was open
   complete rest of line from  suggestions
  :Explore to explore the current directory
  <M-x>, <M-,>, <M-=>, <M-;>, <M-+>, <M-:>
  & repeats the last substitution again
  g& repeats the last substitution globally
  & can stand for \0 in the replacement field of :s
  <C-U> and <C-W> can be used in insert mode to backspace lines/words
  <C-T> and <C-D> can indent/unindent in insert mode

my mappings:
  gx for delete-visual exchange
  gw for swapping a word with the next one
  C-left/right for pushing words left and right
  Function keys - F2 for NERDTree, F9 for Syntastic Check
  <Leader>a to prompt for a Tabularization regex
  Abbreviations xdate, xtime, and xdt to add timestamps
      expand by pressing space or <C-]> for no extra character

  gc<motion>
  <C-_> + _, p, space for configuration, b for block,
